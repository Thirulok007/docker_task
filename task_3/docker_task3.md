# Docker Task 3 – Custom Nginx Image with Docker Compose

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the creation and deployment of a custom Nginx Docker image using Docker Compose. A custom web page was developed and served through an Nginx container. The project also includes bind mount volume configuration at `/var/opt/nginx` and Docker Hub image deployment.

## Technologies Used

* WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Nginx

## Implementation

### Custom Docker Image

A custom Docker image was created using the official Nginx base image. The custom HTML page was copied into the Nginx web root directory through the Dockerfile.

### Docker Compose Deployment

Docker Compose was used to build and deploy the container. Port mapping was configured to expose the application on port `8080`.

### Volume Configuration

A bind mount volume was configured as required.

**Host Path:** `./nginx-data`

**Container Path:** `/var/opt/nginx`

Volume Mapping:

```text
./nginx-data:/var/opt/nginx
```

### Application Access

The deployed application can be accessed through:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

## Results

* Successfully created a custom Nginx Docker image.
* Successfully deployed the container using Docker Compose.
* Successfully configured bind mount volume.
* Successfully served a custom web page through Nginx.
* Successfully pushed the Docker image to Docker Hub.
